- Today VP came in to inform that I made a mistake in my previous assignment. I corrected it. Learnt that the declaration for the tuple is different.
- Attended classes by Pushpendra. He's a good developer and a humble human. He answered all our doubts and taught us about file operations
- The questions given by Mrudul are facinating. I got stuck in those problems thinking solutions to optimize the code. I still have to figure out the extra assignment about arranging coins to form a sum of 200. And also about partition algorithm.
- The assignment is really great but the deadline is very unrealistic because of which I have to hurry and focus less on learning and more on completing the assignment. I think I should inform in prior if I feel that way.
- I learnt that even great programmers cannot perform efficently with unrealistic deadlines.
