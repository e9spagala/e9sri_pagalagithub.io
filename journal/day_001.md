- Had a meeting with Sumanta Gupta and Sakshi Sharma about the program and I signed a form agreeing to all the terms and conditions of the program.
- Visited the Lab space, logged in to the new machines and setup the github profiles

- I got back to the office again to attend few classes as follows

- The first class taught me about the introduction of git and github. Pushpendra is a devoloper who taught about basic git commands.
- The second class took by Adarshi, became my favourate as there is a lot to learn about communication and Adarshi did a great job by drawing parallels between programming and the communicating.
- The third class took by Mrudul who is a data analyst, explained the importance of the maths to sharpen the brain.
